## Automatic Train Boarding Ramp for Indian Railways

Millions of passengers in India face a dangerous gap between the train and the platform every day. This project presents a fully automated train boarding ramp system designed as a conceptual assistive solution for Indian Railways, aimed at improving safety and accessibility for elderly, differently-abled passengers, and travelers with luggage.

The system uses a stepper-motor-driven lead-screw linear actuation mechanism to automatically extend and retract a boarding ramp when the train stops. The project was developed through a complete engineering workflow including problem analysis, concept screening, SolidWorks-based CAD design, mechanical fabrication, electronics integration, automation, and system testing.

This prototype was designed, built, and tested at the Tinkers’ Lab, Ahmedabad University, and demonstrates the feasibility of a mechanically stable, controllable, and manufacturable boarding-assist system for public transport applications.
